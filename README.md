## Abstract
COVID-19 has completely changed the student life. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, most teaching is done via online media from home. A particular problem is that social exchange and communication suffer greatly as a result. Whereas before, students exchanged information before and after class and came into contact with other students, today the contacts are limited to the circle of friends. However, in our opinion, one of the most important factors in student life is lost. With Wasgehtab we would like to offer a solution that directly addresses this problem and provides a suitable way for students and other interested people to connect and network.
